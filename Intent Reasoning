1. The system treats customer notes as signals of intent rather than fixed keywords.

2. Multiple paraphrased inputs expressing urgency and delivery flexibility are grouped into a single intent category.

3. Intent detection is separated from operational rules such as stock and capacity checks.

4. The detected intent is used to validate or refine, not blindly override, the original operational decision.

5. Decisions remain consistent across different phrasings of the same intent.

6. For each decision, alternative actions are explicitly evaluated and rejected with clear reasons.

7. Urgent intent prioritizes speed, while respecting inventory and capacity constraints.

8. This approach ensures explainable, restrained, and repeatable decision-making under ambiguous inputs.
